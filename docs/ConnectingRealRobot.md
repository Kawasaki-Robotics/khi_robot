# Connecting real robot

## 1. Supported AS system

### F Series

Handling: Higher than ASF_01000000W

### OpenAS Series

Handling: Higher than ASE401010XX3S

## 2. Preparation

### 2-1. Robot controller

Make sure that the robot controller used for real-time control satisfies the following conditions.

* The controller is connected with a robot and ready to operate.
* Nobody is inside the safety fence.
* The controller is in [REPEAT] mode.
* TEACH LOCK on the Teach pendant is switched to OFF.
* Robot is not on Hold status.
* No error.
* The controller is connected to an Ubuntu PC with Ethernet cable and both are within the same network subnet.

### 2-2. Ubuntu PC

Make sure that the Ubuntu PC used for real-time control satisfies the following conditions.

* The PC is using realtime kernel for Ubuntu 16.04.
* The user has real-time permissions.
  * (e.g.)Making a real-time group named `realtime`
    1. Make a group and add a user

       ```bash
       sudo addgroup realtime
       sudo usermod -aG realtime $(whoami)
       ```

    2. Add the following limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf`  
       (`memlock` depends on your system)

       ```bash
       @realtime - rtprio 99
       @realtime - priority 99
       @realtime - memlock 512000
       ```

## 3. How to operate on real robot

### 3-1. Start the real-time control

Execute the following command on the ROS running PC to start the real-time control.  

(e.g.)RS007N:

```bash
roslaunch khi_robot_bringup rs007n_bringup.launch ip:=[Controller’s IP address]
```

When the real-time control process is started, the following message will be displayed by the process.  

```bash
KHI robot control started. [NOT REALTIME]/[REALTIME]
```

If the message includes `[REALTIME]`, the process is using `SCHED_FIFO` scheduling.

When the real-time control process is ready to go, the following messages will be displayed by the process.

```bash
[KhiRobotKrnxDriver] State 0: ACTIVATING -> ACTIVE
```

Once the above messages is confirmed, you are able to start real-time control of the robot from the operation interface of “rviz” or the python’s MoveIt! Commander.  
During the real-time control, the display on the Teach pendant will show the figure below.

![START Display on TP](start-display-on-tp.png)]

### 3-2. Terminate the real-time control

Press “Ctrl+C” to end the real-time control.  
Ending process stops the robot controller and turns it to HOLD state. The display on the Teach pendant will show the figure below.

![END Display on TP](end-display-on-tp.png)]

## 4. Driver State

To control robot controller on ROS, the drivere has control states.

![Driver State](driver-state.png)

```text
0:  "INIT"            - Driver init state.
1:  "CONNECTING"      - Driver is now connecting to Robot Controller.
2:  "CONNECTED"       - Driver is connected to Robot Controller, but cannot control Robot Arm.
3:  "ACTIVATING"      - Driver is now activating Robot Arm.
4:  "ACTIVE"          - Driver can control Robot Arm.
5:  "DEACTIVATING"    - Driver is now deactivating Robot Arm.
6:  "DISCONNECTING"   - Driver is now disconnecting to Robot Controller.
7:  "DISCONNECTED"    - Driver is disconnected to Robot Controller.
8:  "ERROR"           - Driver halted due to ERROR.
9:  "RESTART"         - Driver accepts restart instruction.
10: "QUIT"            - Driver accepts quit instruction.
```

You can get this status by Command Service "get_status".

## 5. Command Service

Service "khi_robot_command_service" is available.

Service format is below...

```text

## 7. Precausions

* Make sure to use realtime kernel for Ubuntu 16.04.
* When a robot controller is in the real-time control mode, its state is same as the REPEAT mode. Therefore make sure to the safety issues when the robot controller is in real-time control mode.
* Never make any changes on the sources of the “khi_robot” package.
* Refer to the Documents and community of the MoveIt! for more details on motion/path planning and how to calculate command value.
